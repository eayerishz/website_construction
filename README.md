## Project Overview

The construction company traditionally used Google Sheets to calculate costs, apply markups, and generate summaries for customer projects. This web application enhances this process by allowing:

- **Admins** to create and manage projects, elements, and materials.
- **Users** to register, request project quotations, and view their project statuses.

Admins can add specific project elements and materials, set markups, and generate dynamic, real-time cost calculations that are instantly visible across the app.

## Features

### Admin Functionality
- Full project management.
- Control over project elements and materials, with options to add, remove, or edit.
- Dynamic markup updates on materials with real-time calculations using JavaScript (AJAX/jQuery).
- Ability to approve, decline, or mark projects as completed.

### User Functionality
- Registration, login, and account management.
- Request project quotations by specifying area size, project elements, and materials.
- Access a dashboard displaying their project quotations and statuses.
- Approve or decline quotations once reviewed.

### Project Cycle
